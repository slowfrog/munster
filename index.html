      <h1>You are the Monster in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munster_cheese" target="_blank">Munster<a></h1>
      <p>You play a cheese-eating worm. You must eat cheese until no more than 25% remains.</p>
      <p><span class="key">Arrow keys</span> make your head move, and you body follows as in the game 'snake'. Each time you eat 3 pieces of cheese, you grow by one.</p>
      <p>If you're at least 6 long, you can also split your body by pressing <span class="key">spacebar</span>. A new little worm of size 3 will detach from your end.</p>
      <p>A brown piece of cheese is uneatable.
      A worm that eats a blue piece of cheese becomes confused and moves in the opposite direction.
      A worm that does not eat cheese for too long becomes brown, dies and blocks the way.</p>
      <p>Try to eat 75% of the cheese in as few turns as possible to earn medals, and move to the next level.</p>
      <p>If you're stuck, you can restart the current level with <span class="key">escape</span>.</p>
      <p>You can also see the replay action up to your current state with <span class="key">r</span>.</p>
